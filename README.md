# Automated Image Captioning using Neural Networks

This project focuses on generating textual descriptions from images using neural networks. It combines computer vision and natural language processing techniques to create a model that can generate captions for images. The model is trained on the COCO dataset and uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction and a Transformer model for sequence modeling.

## Introduction
The project aims to improve the state-of-the-art in image captioning by leveraging deep learning techniques. The model is designed to generate contextually appropriate and fluent captions for images, even those not present in the training dataset. The system is evaluated using metrics like BLEU, METEOR, and CIDEr to ensure the quality of the generated captions.

## Features
- **Feature Extraction**: Uses a CNN to extract deep features from images.
- **Sequence Modeling**: Employs a Transformer decoder to generate fluent captions.
- **End-to-End Training**: The model is trained on the COCO dataset for optimal performance.
- **Real-Time Captioning**: Capable of generating captions for unseen images in real-time.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses BLEU, METEOR, and CIDEr to evaluate the quality of generated captions.
